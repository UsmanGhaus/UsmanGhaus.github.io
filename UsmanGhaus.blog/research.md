<em>Conflict and Education: The Case of Iraq</em> <br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper studies the effect of the armed conflict in Iraq on primary school completion. A difference-in-difference approach that exploits the geographical and temporal variation in the number of violent incidents is used to estimate this effect. The results indicate that children belonging to areas affected by the conflict were 6-8% less likely to complete primary school. Enrollment in grade 1 till 3 suffered the most due to conflict. A difference-in-difference-in-difference strategy is then applied to test for the heterogeneity in the effect of conflict across gender. While the results show no significant difference in effects across gender, a complementary analysis using intensity of violent incidents suggests that primary education of young male children suffered the most.<br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <em>Economic Insecurity and Racially Motivated Crimes (with Hina Usman)</em> <br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we identify the relationship between economic insecurity and racially motivated crimes. Treating the 09/11 attacks as an exogenous shock to racial animus among Americans, we first show that the attacks increased hate crimes against certain ethnic and religious groups. Using the regression discontinuity framework, we show that the attacks immediately increased hate crimes by 336 percent compared to the pre-September 11 daily average. We then compare the magnitude of this temporal discontinuity across counties with higher and lower unemployment rates in the year 2000. Consistent with evidence on the adverse effects of unemployment on subjective well-being, our results show that the discontinuity in average daily hate crimes is 326 percent higher in counties that had higher unemployment compared to those that had lower unemployment levels.<br>
